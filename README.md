Example Test Docker Build Action
================================

This is an example repository that uses the [test-docker-build-action](https://github.com/g105b/test-docker-build-action) that I'm using to document the process of building a Github Action that builds a customised Docker image, according to the action's input.

This technique is used in [php-actions](https://github.com/php-actions) so that each action can specify its own version of PHP, which extensions are installed, and the version of the component being run inside the action (Composer, PHPUnit, etc.).
